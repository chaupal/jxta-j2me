/**
 * Write text to a character-output stream, buffering characters so as to
 * provide for the efficient writing of single characters, arrays, and strings.
 * <p/>
 * <p> The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be accepted.
 * The default is large enough for most purposes.
 * <p/>
 * <p> A newLine() method is provided, which uses the platform's own notion of
 * line separator as defined by the system property <tt>line.separator</tt>.
 * Not all platforms use the newline character ('\n') to terminate lines.
 * Calling this method to terminate each output line is therefore preferred to
 * writing a newline character directly.
 * <p/>
 * <p> In general, a Writer sends its output immediately to the underlying
 * character or byte stream.  Unless prompt output is required, it is advisable
 * to wrap a BufferedWriter around any Writer whose write() operations may be
 * costly, such as FileWriters and OutputStreamWriters.  For example,
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * PrintWriter out
 *   = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("foo.out")));
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * will buffer the PrintWriter's output to the file.  Without buffering, each
 * invocation of a print() method would cause characters to be converted into
 * bytes that would then be written immediately to the file, which can be very
 * inefficient.
