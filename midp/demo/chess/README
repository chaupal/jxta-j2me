1. Installation

Install the JXME project as described here : http://jxme.jxta.org/build.html

The JXMEChess application is included in JXME and should be present in the 
directory : jxme/midp/demo/chess

Compile the JXMEChess application :
  cd jxme/midp/demo/chess
  ant

To run JXMEChess :
  cd jxme/midp/demo/chess
  ant run



2. Using the JXMEChess demo

- open two shell windows and run 2 instances of JXMEChess :
  cd jxme/midp/demo/chess
  ant

- "Launch" the MIDlets from the phone emulators.

- click "Setting"

- you can use your own JXTA proxy or this remote one : 
    Proxy host : 209.25.154.233
    Proxy port : 9700

- use 2 different screen name in each MIDlet instance (eg. player1 and player2)

- click OK in both emulators (it will save your settings in the MIDlet RMS)

- connect your MIDlets : Menu/Connect. You should see in your shell windows these
  messages :

     [exec] Connect took : 1170 ms.
     [exec] Saving the persistent state in RMS : [B@ea0ef881
     [exec] listen query id: 0
     [exec] player1> 1 message received.
     [exec]    response = info
     [exec]    requestId = 0
     [exec]    type = PIPE
     [exec]    name = JXTAChess-player1
     [exec]    id = urn:jxta:uuid-59616261646162614E504720503250331DEC91B416044721ABAC8BDB24CA90D404
     [exec]    arg = JxtaUnicast
     [exec]    EndpointDestinationAddress = http://JxtaHttpClientuuid-59616261646162614A7874615032503350C5809E076B415BA4CB9559832F786E03/
     [exec]    EndpointSourceAddress = http://209.25.154.233:9700/
     [exec] player1> 1 message received.
     [exec]    response = success
     [exec]    requestId = 0
     [exec]    EndpointDestinationAddress = http://JxtaHttpClientuuid-59616261646162614A7874615032503350C5809E076B415BA4CB9559832F786E03/
     [exec]    EndpointSourceAddress = http://209.25.154.233:9700/

  
- then search the connected players in both MIDlets : Menu/Search Players

- once you have seen in the shell windows that both players have found each other
  start a new game from one MIDlet : Menu/New Game. Choose your opponent and the color
  to play with.

- on the other MIDlet, you should receive a game invitation :
  eg. "The player player1 invited you for playing ..."
  Accept it by pressing "Yes"

- after a few seconds the chessboards are shown on both MIDlets

- the 3 player screen names are shown at the bottom of the chessboard and the
  name in bold letters has to play.

- use the phone cursor to select a move
